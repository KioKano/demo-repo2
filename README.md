# Demo 2

Some text.

Git branching uses commits onto the feature branch, which acts as a sandbox, before merging back to the main branch.
This is great for collaborations and to test out new features, hence the name.

When there is a huge bug that appears, a hot fix branch is used to patch them before merging into main branch.
